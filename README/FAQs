1. How to run:
The package thoughtworks.problem.salesTax.application contains Application.java file, which is a starting point of the application.
Program should run for the default input file "Input/input1.txt" for the first time. Input can be changed by specifying a different file path 
in Application.java or by un-commenting other default file paths.

2. How to change default values of sales tax, import duty etc.?
All these constants are defined in Constants.java in thoughtworks.problem.salesTax.constants package. Edit this file for default values, as well 
as rounding up rules, resolution etc.

3. Why is the output not printed out in the same format as the input file?
The application is programmed to eliminate certain keywords from output in the interest of simplicity

4. Where are the test cases?
All test cases, written in order to test the most important aspects of program are present in  thoughtworks.problem.salesTax.test package.

5. What should I do, if I get an incomplete package or if the files are corrupted?
In such an unlikely scenario, you should sync your Mercurial repository with:
