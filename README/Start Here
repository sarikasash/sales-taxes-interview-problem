How to run:
The zip file contains an exported eclipse project. The quickest way to run the code is to unzip the file and
import the unzipped folder as a project in eclipse. Since eclipse is the standard java development IDE, an assumption is
made that eclipse is available. If not, the same can be downloaded from http://eclipse.org/.
Test cases can be independently run from the respective package but will require eclipse to be capable of running JUnit.
